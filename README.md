Utility scripts, etc for getting wireguard onto a PiCorePlayer instance.

This was inspired by:
  1. an attempt to keep the installation & configuration as self-contained as possible, so it can exist in /home/tc (and be "backed up"), rather than creating a extension
  2. the need to bring the wireguard-tools into picoreplayer version > 8
